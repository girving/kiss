Investigations into sphere kissing numbers in 3D
================================================

An attempt to make an physical realization of the property that, while only 12
unit spheres can be fit around a central unit sphere in three dimensions, there
is enough space left over to arbitrarily permute the outer spheres without losing
contact.
